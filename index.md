# About AJ

Hello!! This is an md file that talks about me!!

First, I just want to begin by saying a bit about me and what I like to do. So, I am a big nerd. I really enjoy watching cartoons, animes, and action movies. I also really enjoy playing videogames like Terraria, Phasmophobia, Dokkan Battle, and Deep Rocket Galatic.

Next, I want to discusss a little bit more about my hobbies. For example, I love to play music. I am a Trumpet Player for the University of Utah Marching Band. I have been able to travel to many places in the nation to perform and play our music. It has honestly been one of my most fondest hobbies by far. As well, I enjoy watching a lot of content of various streamers and I love watching sports. I enjoy watching the athletic programs of the University of Utah, but I am also a Utah Jazz fan and a Greenbay Packer fan!! Go Pack Go!!

Here are my 2 strongest hobbies right now, first I am a huge fan of Dokkan Battle so the first image was one of the icons that the mobile app game has used. Then the second photo is of my favorite team right now, I am really excited for the future of the Greenbay Packers, here's to hoping they make it to a Super Bowl this upcoming season!
